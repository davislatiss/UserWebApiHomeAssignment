# UserWebApiHomeAssignment

Launch the project from KleintechTestTask.sln file.

I started with creating the persons and address classes and class properties as given in the example.
Added the sql Db for data storage as instructed. Created methods for adding, deleting and updating marriage status
for persons in the admin controler. 
Created structure for the project. Now the API consists of Core, Data and Services class libraries plus the Web project.
Interfaces created for Services.
Created a method for calculating age of each person. Added dependency injections.
Project is still mising the UI part because of time constraints.
